# Semi Autonomous Fire-Fighting Vehicle
This is the repository containing all the codes, report and presentation of the Semi Autonomous Fire Fighting Vehicle built by MMM Hall of Residence during the Hardware Modelling Competetion, 2019.

## Problem Statement: 
To build a semi-autonomous fire-fighting robot capable of replacing/ assisting human fire-fighters during indoor or outdoor fire situations encompassing appropriate audio-visual communication systems and fire-safety equipment for aiding trapped humans, and being capable of extinguishing multiple types of fires, thereby ensuring complete safety of human firefighters in fire situations.

## SAFFV (Semi-Autonomous Fire-Fighting Vehicle)
Considering the problem, we came up with a product with great potential to replace a human fire-fighter. Following are the major functionalities of the robot-  
⦁	Capable of all-terrain traversal with the help of skid steer drive consisting of caterpillar mechanism similar to tanks. Angled front and back extension of belt provides the ability to traverse on debris and rubble giving the bot an all-terrain traversal ability.  
⦁	Live thermal imaging and vision feed which can be accessed with the help of Wifi. The thermal camera feed can be easily used to find humans even in the presence of thick smoke.  
⦁	Audio feed and audio communication through 2.4GHz radio frequency.  
⦁	Full Wireless control of the robot over 2.4Ghz Radio wave frequency.  
⦁	Provision of a continuous water supply of 10000 cc/min with the ability to increase it as per requirement. Secondary CO2 based fire extinguisher (2kg) to extinguish small fires at a rapid rate.  
⦁	Safety box containing gas mask, helmet, and other fire-safety equipment for the survivors.
